"""Non-dimensional solvers for the ORIGINAL (implicit) Saarelma-Connor
pedestal model, in a Firedrake and a scipy implementation.

Model
=====
This module solves the *original* Saarelma-Connor model: the single
implicit second-order ODE for the electron density that is obtained
after the two neutral fluids have been eliminated analytically
(S. Saarelma et al 2023 Nucl. Fusion 63 052002; Eqs. (6)-(7) of the
Labbate APAM E9301 report; rigorous derivations in
docs/derivation_eq16.tex and docs/derivation_eq15.tex).  Only the
electron density is solved for -- the neutrals never appear as unknowns,
they enter through the closed-form closures already substituted into
Eqs. (6)-(7).

Step 1 -- the no-CX "first step" (report Eq. 6 == Saarelma Eq. 16):

    d/dx [ <|grad r|^2> D_ped dn_e/dx ]
        = n_e D_ped (S_i + S_CX) / (|V_FC| f_FC)
              * ( dn_e/dx - dn_e/dx|_in )                    (eq6_form="paper")

    d/dx [ <|grad r|^2> D_ped dn_e/dx ]
        = n_e (S_i + S_CX) / (1 + S_CX/(2 S_i))
              * <|grad r|^2> D_ped / (|V_FC| f_FC)
              * ( dn_e/dx - dn_e/dx|_in )               (eq6_form="complete")

``eq6_form`` selects between the equation exactly as printed and the
complete form of docs/derivation_eq16.tex Eq. (16-full), from which the
printed one follows by dropping the shape factor 1 + S_CX/(2 S_i)
(assumption A5) and by cancelling the <|grad r|^2> of the transport
operator against the D_ped of the neutral closure (a *symbolic*
cancellation that is only legitimate when <|grad r|^2> ~ 1).  The two
differ by the factor (1 + S_CX/(2 S_i)) / <|grad r|^2>, which is not a
detail: on the DIII-D 158091 case shipped with this repository
<|grad r|^2> ~ 0.05, so the printed form is ~35x stiffer than the
complete one -- its solution amplifies by exp(176) across the pedestal
and neither implementation can solve it in double precision, whereas
the complete form amplifies by ~70 and converges.  ``"complete"`` is
therefore the default; it is also the form consistent with Eq. (7)
below, which keeps <|grad r|^2> D_ped in the same place.

Step 2 -- the full implicit equation (report Eq. 7 == the corrected
Saarelma Eq. 15):

    d/dx [ <|grad r|^2> D_ped dn_e/dx ]
        = - n_e S_i { - <|grad r|^2> D_ped / (|V_CX| f_CX)
                          * ( dn_e/dx - dn_e/dx|_in )
                      + C_CX(x) <n_FC>(0) E(x) }

with the CX-flux coefficient and the FC attenuation ("optical depth")
kernel

    C_CX(x) = 1 - ( |V_FC| f_FC / (|V_CX| f_CX) )
                  * (S_i + S_CX/2) / (S_i + S_CX)
    E(x)    = exp[ int_0^x n_e(x') (S_i + S_CX) / (f_FC |V_FC|) dx' ].

(The form factors f_FC and f_CX are carried explicitly.  The report
writes Eq. 6 with f_FC = 1 -- assumption A4 of docs/derivation_eq16.tex,
which is what ``saarelma_connor.form_factor`` sets -- so the two forms
agree identically for the current form-factor model.)

The pedestal diffusivity is

    D_ped(x, n_e) = D_NEO(x) + D_KBM(x) + C_ETG(x) / n_e,

with C_ETG = De_chie_etg * P_tot_e / (S_plasma |dT_e/dx|) and D_KBM from
the pedestal-averaged Connor-Hastie alpha (Saarelma Eqs. 24-25); see
:meth:`saarelma_connor_sc.calc_D_KBM_average_sc`.

Implicit (Picard) solve
=======================
Following Saarelma et al. (2023), the non-local kernel E(x) makes Eq. (7)
an integro-differential equation, so it is solved implicitly:

    1. Solve Eq. (6) (no CX neutrals) for a first n_e profile.
    2. Iterate Eq. (7): on each Picard iteration E(x) is evaluated with
       the *previous* n_e and frozen, and D_KBM is refrozen from the
       latest n_e using the pedestal-averaged ("average" gate mode)
       alpha -- exactly the treatment of
       ``solver_nondim.solve_coupled_nondim`` with
       ``kbm_treatment="picard"`` / ``picard_gate_mode="average"``
       (frozen scalar-gated diffusivity, optional under-relaxation).
       Repeat until the profile and the gate state stop changing.

Two practical notes on this loop, both observed on the DIII-D 158091
case and both controllable from the solver signature:

  * Step 1 can have *no solution*.  Eq. (6) is a positive-feedback
    amplifier (more density gradient -> larger implied <n_FC> -> more
    ionisation -> more gradient), and for a steep enough inner-boundary
    slope every profile collapses to n_e ~ 0 before reaching the
    separatrix, so no member of the family satisfies n_e(0) = ne_x0.
    Saarelma et al. only use Eq. (16) as "a convenient starting point",
    so ``first_step`` selects "eq6" (always run it, raise on failure),
    "skip" (go straight to the Eq. 7 Picard loop from ``initial_guess``)
    or "auto" (default: try Eq. 6, warn and fall back to "skip").
  * The KBM gate can limit-cycle.  When the converged alpha_bar sits
    close to alpha_crit the whole-pedestal gate flips every iteration
    and the profile alternates between two states forever.  Damp it with
    ``picard_relax`` < 1 (0.5 works on the case above); the
    non-convergence error message diagnoses this explicitly.

Non-dimensionalisation
======================
    xi = x / L,    L  = |x_inner|,                 xi in [-1, 0]
    N  = n_e / n0, n0 = ne_x0,                     N(0) = 1
    S0 = S_i(0)   (separatrix ionisation rate coefficient)
    [V]_0 = L n0 S0,        [D]_0 = L^2 n0 S0

Writing f(x, n_e) = <|grad r|^2> D_ped for the total conductance and
splitting off its n_e dependence, f = f0(x) + f1(x)/n_e with

    f0 = <|grad r|^2> (D_NEO + D_KBM),   f1 = <|grad r|^2> C_ETG,

the expanded non-dimensional ODEs solved by the scipy implementation are

    Eq. 6:  N'' = C_A6 N (N' - N'_in) - C_K N' + C_N (N')^2
    Eq. 7:  N'' = C_A  N (N' - N'_in) - C_E N - C_K N' + C_N (N')^2

    C_A6 = n0 L (S_i + S_CX) / (<|grad r|^2> |V_FC| f_FC)      ("paper")
         = n0 L (S_i + S_CX) / ((1 + S_CX/(2 S_i)) |V_FC| f_FC)
                                                            ("complete")
    C_A  = n0 L S_i / (|V_CX| f_CX)
    C_E  = L^2 S_i C_CX <n_FC>(0) E(x) / f
    C_K  = (L / f) ( df0/dx + (1/n_e) df1/dx )
    C_N  = f1 / (n0 N^2 f)

where N'_in = (L/n0) dn_e/dx|_in is the non-dimensional Neumann value
(cf. docs/derivation_eq16.tex Sec. "Non-dimensionalization").

The Firedrake implementation keeps the conservative form.  With
hat_f = f/[D]_0, hat_S = S/S0, hat_V = V/[V]_0 and hat_nFC0 = nFC_x0/n0
the strong forms are

    Eq. 6:  d/dxi[hat_f N'] = N (hat_f / <|grad r|^2>)
                (hat_S_i + hat_S_CX) (N' - N'_in) / (hat_V_FC f_FC)
                                                            ("paper")
            d/dxi[hat_f N'] = N hat_f (hat_S_i + hat_S_CX)
                / (1 + hat_S_CX/(2 hat_S_i))
                * (N' - N'_in) / (hat_V_FC f_FC)         ("complete")
    Eq. 7:  d/dxi[hat_f N'] = N hat_S_i [ hat_f (N' - N'_in)
                / (hat_V_CX f_CX) - C_CX hat_nFC0 E(xi) ]

which are multiplied by a test function w and integrated by parts in the
usual way (the residuals are assembled in
:meth:`saarelma_connor_sc.solve_sc_firedrake`).

Agreement between the two implementations
-----------------------------------------
On the DIII-D 158091 case the converged profiles agree to ~3e-3 in
max-norm, and each satisfies its own discrete Eq. (7) far better than
that (the conservative residual of the Firedrake solution falls as the
mesh is refined, ~1e-3 at x_res = 400; the scipy solution sits at ~2e-4
of its own collocation problem).  The residual difference between them
is dominated not by the discretisation but by how each reconstructs the
equilibrium coefficients between the points of the (coarse) p-file
grid: the Firedrake path samples them with ``np.interp`` into the finite
element space, as the rest of this repository does, while the scipy path
needs df/dx and therefore uses a shape-preserving PCHIP interpolant.

Boundary conditions (the only supported combination):

    Neumann   at xi = -1 (inner):  N'(-1) = (L/n0) dn_e/dx|_in
    Dirichlet at xi =  0 (outer):  N(0)   = 1  (i.e. n_e(0) = ne_x0)

Free parameters: alpha_crit, De_chie_etg, C_KBM, nFC_x0 -- set through
the parent constructor, through ``update_free_params``, or per solve
through the ``free_params`` argument of either entry point.

This module subclasses :class:`src.solver.saarelma_connor`, so all
equilibrium / kinetic / cross-section initialisation is inherited
unchanged; ``src/solver.py`` is left untouched.

        Parameters
        ----------
        x_res : int
            Number of points of the (uniform) non-dimensional solver
            grid handed to ``solve_bvp`` as its initial mesh.
        free_params : dict or None
            Optional free parameters applied before solving; see
            :meth:`_ensure_sc_setup`.
        bc_origin : {"p-file", "user"}
            Where the Neumann inner slope comes from: the p-file density
            gradient at x_inner, or the user-supplied ``dne_dx_inner``.
        dne_dx_inner : float or None
            SI inner-boundary slope (m^-4, must be negative) when
            ``bc_origin="user"``.
        initial_guess : {"pfile", "linear", "tanh"}
            Shape of the initial n_e profile (SI), as in solver_nondim.
        tanh_width, tanh_center : float or None
            Parameters of the "tanh" initial guess (SI metres).
        eq6_form : {"complete", "paper"}
            Which form of the first step to solve; see the module
            docstring.  "paper" is Eq. 6 exactly as printed and is only
            usable when <|grad r|^2> is close to 1: otherwise it either
            fails outright or converges to a collapsed profile that the
            Eq. (7) iteration cannot then start from.
        first_step : {"auto", "eq6", "skip"}
            Whether to run step 1 at all.  "eq6" always runs it and
            raises if it fails; "skip" starts the Eq. (7) Picard loop
            directly from ``initial_guess``; "auto" (default) tries
            Eq. (6) and falls back to "skip" with a ``RuntimeWarning``
            if it has no solution (see :meth:`_first_step_failed_sc`).
        picard_max_it : int
            Maximum number of Picard iterations of the full Eq. (7).
        picard_rtol : float
            Relative max-norm tolerance on the change in n_e between
            Picard iterations.
        picard_relax : float in (0, 1]
            Under-relaxation of the frozen D_KBM and E(x) updates.
        bvp_tol : float
            ``solve_bvp`` residual tolerance.
        bvp_max_nodes : int
            ``solve_bvp`` maximum number of mesh nodes.
        reuse_setup : bool
            Reuse cached solver grids / form factors when the resolution
            is unchanged (set False after changing the equilibrium).
        verbose : bool or None
            Override ``self.verbose``.

        Returns
        -------
        x_sol, ne_sol, dne_dx_sol : ndarray

        Solves the same non-dimensional two-step problem as
        :meth:`solve_sc_scipy` but in conservative (weak) form with CG
        finite elements and SNES Newton for each frozen-coefficient
        nonlinear solve:

            Step 1 (report Eq. 6, no CX; ``eq6_form="paper"``):
                F6 = int hat_f N' w' dxi
                     + int N (hat_f/g)(hat_Si + hat_Scx)(N' - N'_in)

                     + hat_f N'_in w ds(1) = 0
            (``eq6_form="complete"`` replaces hat_f/g by
             hat_f / (1 + hat_Scx/(2 hat_Si)); see the module docstring)

            Step 2 (report Eq. 7, Picard on E(x) and D_KBM):
                F7 = int hat_f N' w' dxi
                     + int N hat_Si [ hat_f (N' - N'_in)/(hat_V_CX f_CX)
                                      - C_CX hat_nFC0 E ] w dxi
                     + hat_f N'_in w ds(1) = 0

        with hat_f = g (hat_D_NEO + hat_D_KBM) + g hat_C_ETG / N (the ETG
        piece keeps its 1/N dependence inline, so Newton differentiates
        it exactly), Dirichlet N(0) = 1 (boundary id 2), and the Neumann
        inner flux imposed weakly through ds(1) (boundary id 1).

        The frozen KBM diffusivity ``hat_D_KBM`` and kernel ``E`` are
        Functions refreshed between Picard iterations from the latest
        density -- the same "average"-gate Picard pedestal-pressure
        treatment as ``solver_nondim`` (Saarelma Eqs. 24-25 diffusivity
        frozen into the D-slot, optional under-relaxation).

        Parameters are as in :meth:`solve_sc_scipy`, plus the finite
        element / PETSc controls of the parent coupled solver
        (``fe_degree``, ``linear_solver``, ``ksp_rtol``, ``ksp_max_it``).
